# Simulated TUNL Experiments and Data Analysis

This repository contains the code needed to train Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents on the simulated Trial-Unique, Nonmatch-to-Location (TUNL) memory task, collect responses of LSTM neurons in trained DRL agents, and analyze the data.
&nbsp;

The simulated TUNL experiments are conceptualized by [Dongyan Lin](http://dongyanl1n.github.io) and [Blake Richards](http://linclab.org/) and coded by Dongyan Lin.

The experiment details, analyses and results are published in [Lin & Richards, 2021, _bioRxiv_](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.15.452557v1).
